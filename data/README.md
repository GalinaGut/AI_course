## Chapter 1 – Customer Order Dataset
Prompt used: "Generate 15 customer orders ..."
Observations:
- Values are realistic but totals sometimes inconsistent.
- Status distribution is roughly balanced.
- Useful as a baseline for Chapter 2 refinement.

## Chapter 2 – Data Variety and Extended Schema
Prompt used:
  "Generate 30 customer orders with an expanded status list, boundary totals, a few intentionally invalid rows flagged as isValid=false, and include email, phoneNumber, and items array fields."
Observations:
  - Added new statuses to mirror production states.
  - Introduced 3 invalid rows for validation testing.
  - Totals include edge boundaries (0, 9999, -12).
  - Each record now includes contact details and an items array.
  - The file stays schema-consistent for valid rows and clearly marks invalid ones.
